This information system is created to improve work, systematize information and monitor the performance of duties by employees of the telephone company. A telephone company is an organization that provides telephone services. Employees of the telephone company registered in advance by the administrator and authorized to work with the system under development.

According to the specifics of the work of telephone companies, the most important essence of the system can be considered tariffs (tariff plans), according to which the company provides its services and information about which is contained in the relational database. Tariffs have different costs, and accordingly, a different list of services for a certain tariff. Another entity that affects the price of services is the presence of a benefit for the client: depending on the benefit, a percentage of the cost of the tariff, which the user must pay, is calculated.

The system tracks customer calls and stores information about them, calculates the cost of the call depending on the tariff plan to which the customer is connected. Another important aspect of the company's work is the tracking and recording of various payments and their purpose.

There are three users in the designed system. First, the administrator, who has the ability to add new customers, edit information about them, connect the customer to a certain benefit, add a new tariff to the system, edit information about existing tariffs and delete outdated ones, do the same for benefits. Secondly, the support service manager, who for the purpose of consulting can view information about the client, his tariffs, payments and benefits, as well as change the tariff of a certain client to a new one; and a consultant who can report on consultations and review inquiries to answer client questions.
